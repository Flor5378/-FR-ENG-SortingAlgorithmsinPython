# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing and animating several classic sorting algorithms in Python:  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

Each algorithm is visualized through an animation that demonstrates the step-by-step sorting process.
